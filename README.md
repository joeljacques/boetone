Music theory representation and experimentation in Scala
## Idea
By defining music from basic structures up, we can experiment with harmonies through applying different rules,
for standards like 
- standard pitch (usually 440 herz)
- pitch spaces (base for scales)
- pitch classes (base for pitch spaces)
and more.

It could also serve as base of some kind of rule-based music generator.
## next goals
### 1. Finish theoretic base
Implement as much music theory structures as possible. Examples for "music theory structures" are tuning, roman numeral analysis or tritone inversions.

### 2. Sound Output
Build a module that can play notes, and chords and sequences of those.
